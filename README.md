# Image Classification using Keras
A basic Neural Network that can classify images of handwritten digits.

## Dataset:
Modified version of MNIST dataset, where default training and testing are merged and then randomly split into 67% for training and 33% for testing.

## Model Generation:
Generation of 15 models, each with varying one of the parameters:
1) Activation functions: Rectified Linear Unit, Sigmoid or Tanh
2) Number of hidden layers: 2 or 3
3) Number of Neurons per hidden layer: 100 or 150
